# Everything is staged into a fresh folder rather than packed from the repo, because the
# repo's backend/node_modules carries development packages, and public/images holds
# whatever teams the builder happened to upload while testing. Those are the builder's
# own data and must never be shipped: see EXCLUDED below and the guard in
# backend/tests/media.test.ts.
