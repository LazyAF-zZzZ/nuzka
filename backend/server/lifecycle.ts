// Shutting down cleanly when the desktop app goes away.
//
// In v3 this server is a child process of the desktop app, not code running inside
// Electron. The app stops it when it closes, and a plain kill loses whatever the
// operator changed in the last 150 ms (saveStateSoon debounces the write) and leaves
// the SQLite WAL un-checkpointed.
//
// The desktop app keeps our stdin open for as long as it runs and closes it to ask us
// to stop. We flush, close the database and exit. stdin also closes when the app
// crashes, so this path runs then too, unless Windows' job object gets there first.
//
// Only active when ROV_EXIT_WITH_PARENT=1, so `npm start` in a terminal behaves as
// it always has.
