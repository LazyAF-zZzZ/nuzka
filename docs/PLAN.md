# ROV Overlay Tool v3: Plan and Decisions

This is the working design document for v3. It is written to stand alone: a fresh
session with no conversation history should be able to continue from here and
`CLAUDE.md`. The v2 design history is kept, read-only, in `docs/v2/`.

## 0. Where things stand

**Last updated 2026-09-28: supporter keys S1-S3 done (§10), ready to ship together once the user has seen the watermark in OBS and chosen prices. Before that, 2026-09-27: S1, S2. Before that, 2026-09-14. M1 `e826fb3`, M2 `6f736b3`, M3 `ab3bdf8`, M4 `c3ac12a`, M5 `3fcb2a9`, M6 `c615d39`, M7 `79c5f41`, M8 `7e13667`, 3.0.6 and 3.0.7 in the commits after those, the flow and UI work in `83e558c`, 3.0.8 in `182ea91`.**

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Backend (`backend/`) | Copied from v2 at `6c69766` (v2.0.2 plus two overlay commits). Builds; **373 tests, all passing, nothing skipped**. M6 added the v2 importer; M7 revived the "installer never ships uploaded images" guard; M8 added `tests/packaging.test.ts`, which keeps the bundle's page list honest in both directions. |
| Desktop app (`desktop/`) | WPF on .NET 10. Builds with no warnings. Starts or attaches to the backend, live title strip, sidebar, OBS source list, toasts, Thai/English, back stack (Esc / mouse back), notice bell, first-run licence. |
| Native screens | **All of them**: Home, tournament detail, team registry, team profile, Control Panel, bracket, analytics, pick/ban history, Design, Hotkeys, Guide, Settings. No screen opens a web page any more, and since M8 the installer no longer carries the ten HTML operator pages they replaced. The manual (`/guide`) and the sound check (`/sfx-test`) still ship: nothing replaced those, and the Guide screen has a button that opens the manual in a browser. |
| Verified how | Every native screen rendered with seeded data (--snapshot, §3) in both languages; anything in its own window cannot be (§8), which is how 3.0.0 shipped unable to open one at all. 3.0.5 has been **installed from its own Setup and watched opening a real window**, serving its overlays and answering 410 on the pages the installer drops. The v2 import runs against a synthetic v2 install in the tests, with the v2 folder asserted byte-identical afterwards. The **game-over flow has been clicked through for real**: on 2026-09-14 with the GAME OVER buttons, and again on 2026-09-15 after they became **+1** on the score - `scripts/uia.ps1` pressed +1 twice and Put on air in a live window against a throwaway backend, checked there was no dialog, that the server recorded 1-0 then 2-0 with the series complete and no game 3, and that the panel read "PSG Esports win the series 2–0". The other clicking flows are still unverified (§8). |
| Updates / notifications | **Built** (§5). Velopack 1.2.0 against GitHub Releases, applied when the app closes and never on its own; a notice feed with a bell in the title bar. |

Next: whatever the people using it ask for. 3.0.5 through **3.0.9** are published. New
versions reach people on their own, but from 3.0.9 they are only *installed* when the
operator presses Update now (§5). **3.0.10** (2026-09-15): GAME OVER's two "won"
buttons and their confirmation are gone (user's request). The winner is counted
from the score: a **+1** beside each team's score ends the game for that side through the same
`POST /api/live-match/finish`, which now also returns `seriesWinner` and `score`, and the
SERIES OVER bar names the winner ("PSG Esports win the series 2–1"). Typing in the score box
still only corrects the number.

**3.0.11: teams swap sides every game** (user's request, 2026-09-15; clicked through for real),
on by default, switchable beside ROUND (`state.swapSidesEachRound`, carried over like `sfx`;
socket `setSwapSides`). Tournament games: `goLive` puts team B on blue for even game numbers
and flips the restored draft and the series score to match. **The frozen game copy is not
changed** - it still says team A = blue - so draft capture, score sync and the previous-rounds
board, which all go through `orientationOf`, credit the right team exactly as they already did
for a manual Switch Teams. Quick matches: `stepRound` swaps the two team objects on every step,
and `restoreRound` places a filed draft by team name. Tested in `tests/side-swap.test.ts`.

**3.1.2: Settings lost two sections** (user's request, 2026-09-16): "Your
data" (the data and media folder paths with Open folder buttons) and "Bring your v2 data across"
(the v2 importer's only UI). Both were judged unnecessary. **The v2 importer's server side stays**
(`http://api-import.ts`, `domain/import-v2.ts`, `tests/import-v2.test.ts`) - only the screen is gone,
so restoring the box is a XAML + view-model change, not a rebuild. Anyone moving from v2 now saves a
backup there and restores it here, which both guides say instead of the old import steps; the guide
still lists the folder paths under "Where your files are". `Loc.M6.cs` is deleted and the
`Settings.Data*` / `Settings.OpenFolder` keys with it.

**3.1.1: team card graphic** (user's request, 2026-09-15).
`/overlay-team-card` shows one team for the break before a match: logo and name, five tiles
(series, games, on blue, on red, last five series), most picked heroes with win rates, heroes
banned against them, and each player's favourite heroes. Data is `GET /api/team-card`, which
wraps `teamStats.forTeam`, the same numbers as the team page's Statistics tab. **It follows a
side, not a team** (`?side=blue|red`, read from `state.team*.logo.src`, the registry id that
`goLive` and `loadTeamIntoSide` put there), because teams swap sides every game; the page reloads
when the id on its side changes in `stateUpdate`, never on every state push. `?team=<id>` pins a
team; `?tournament=<id>|all`, default the on-air match's tournament. A typed-in side or an unusable
`?team=` is a 404 and the page clears the old card rather than leaving it under the message. It
reuses `overlay-matchup.css` for panels, entrance and 1440p scaling, plus `overlay-team-card.css`.
Two OBS list rows (blue, red) in both lists. Tested in `tests/team-card.test.ts`.

**3.1.1 also: two overlay fixes** (user's request, 2026-09-15, found by
photographing every overlay against the 5 × 32 test data). **Head to head and Team picks & bans
coloured the teams by bracket side, not screen side:** following the match on air they took team A
as blue, so since sides swap every game (3.0.11) every even game, and any game after Switch Teams,
had the colours backwards against the main overlay. `liveTeamsOnScreen()` in `live-match.ts` returns
the on-air pair ordered by `isDisplaySwapped` (the same check draft capture uses) and both endpoints
use it; a test asserts the team card, `/api/matchup` and `/api/team-drafts` agree with
`state.teamBlue` in games 1 and 2. **Standings was unreadable for big tables:** `fitToStage` shrank
the whole board with `transform`, so width shrank too and a 32-team knockout became a narrow strip.
It now steps a `--st-font` variable down from 34px to the largest size that fits, and only then
shrinks; a lone group of more than 12 rows splits into two side-by-side tables with ranks
continuing; a format without groups is labelled "All teams", not "Group main". Checked in the
Browser pane: 32 teams at 20px in two tables, four groups of four at 31px, neither transformed.

**3.1.0: hotkeys on by default, with the score and the rounds** (user's request,
2026-09-15). Six new `GLOBAL_HOTKEY_ACTIONS`: `bluePlus` / `redPlus` (Ctrl+Alt+1 / 2), `blueMinus`
/ `redMinus` (Ctrl+Alt+Q / W), `prevRound` / `nextRound` (Ctrl+Alt+A / S): **a 2×3 block under the
left hand holding Ctrl+Alt**, blue left and red right like the screen. The first layout
(Ctrl+Alt+Shift+digits, Ctrl+Alt+PageUp / PageDown) was rejected by the user: too far apart to
press with one hand while the other stays on the mouse in OBS. The user then asked for **every**
system-wide key to follow it, so the draft keys moved too: `prevPhase` / `nextPhase` Ctrl+Alt+E / R,
`pauseResume` Ctrl+Alt+D, `toggleBanner` Ctrl+Alt+F, `undo` stays Ctrl+Alt+Z. The old H / Space /
arrows needed two hands, and Ctrl+Alt+Space was already held by another program on the user's
machine. **`globalHotkeys.layout` (now 2)** moves saved bindings still equal to the layout-1 defaults
to the new ones exactly once; keys someone chose stay, and the stamp stops a later deliberate
Ctrl+Alt+H from being moved again. Keep new defaults inside the block.
**Trap found by pressing the keys for real:** with the app in focus, a system-wide Ctrl+Alt key
also toggled the banner through the Control Panel's local "tap Alt" shortcut. `RegisterHotKey`
swallows the letter's key press but not the modifier releases, so the panel saw Alt go down and up
and counted a tap; Ctrl+Alt+F flipped the banner twice and looked dead. `ControlView` now arms a
tap only when no other modifier is held, and any ordinary key release cancels it.
The score and round keys call `finishGame`,
`undoGame` and `stepRound`, the same functions as the buttons, and **blue/red is the side on
screen when pressed**, like the buttons (so after a +1 and a side swap, the winner's -1 is the
other colour; the Hotkeys page and the guide say so). `POST /api/global-hotkeys/fire` now returns
`{ ok, changed, code?, error?, finish?, undo? }`, always 200 for a refusal. **The finish/undo
result has to reach the Control Panel**: its SERIES OVER bar and "Put on air" next match are built
from the +1 reply, so a series ended from OBS would otherwise be recorded with no bar. The
desktop host raises `AppServices.HotkeyFired`; `ControlViewModel` shows it through the same
`ShowFinished` as its button and sets `Handled`; anything unhandled (refusals, rounds) is toasted
by the host through `GameFlowText`, which both now share. `FinishGameResult` / `UndoGameResult`
gained `teamName`, read before the sides swap, because the host has no name in hand. Hotkeys
recording learned PageUp/PageDown, Home/End, Insert/Delete, F1–F24 and the numpad. System-wide
keys are now **on by default and called just "Hotkeys"** (user's request): first section of the
Hotkeys page, with the Control Panel's own keys below. Saved settings from before layout 2 are
switched on as they migrate (off was the default then, so an off from those versions says nothing);
once stamped, switching them off sticks. This reverses v2's "off until asked for" rule, and
`backend/CLAUDE.md` says so. Tested in `tests/global-hotkeys.test.ts`.

**3.0.13: full team statistics** (user's request, 2026-09-15; smoke-tested before packing). The team
page has Profile / Statistics tabs; Statistics shows series and games records with win rates,
the last five series, side records, heroes picked (games, pick rate, win rate), bans made,
bans against, record vs each opponent and each player's hero pool, all filterable to one
tournament (`GET /api/teams/:id/stats[?tournamentId=]`, `store/team-stats.ts`, same counting
rules as analytics: locked drafts only, sides from the frozen copy, win rates from decided
games). **Migration step 6** adds `games.sides_swapped` and a `game_players` table, written by
`captureDraft` with every draft, because neither the side a team actually played on screen nor
who sat in each row was recorded anywhere. **Both count only from 3.0.13 on**; earlier games
show as "side unknown" and have no player pool, never guessed. Backups carry both fields
(optional, so older backup files still restore; `BACKUP_VERSION` unchanged). Tested in
`tests/team-stats.test.ts` and `tests/backup.test.ts`. The snapshot switch `--then stats`
opens a team's Statistics tab.

**3.0.12 (2026-09-15; clicked through for real, including -1 disabled at 0):**

- **-1 beside each score** (`POST /api/live-match/undo`, `undoGame`): the exact undo of +1.
  Lowers the score through `pushOverlayScoreToMatch`, so the game's winner is cleared and a
  series that point had ended is reopened with its winner pulled back out of the next match,
  then `goLive`s that game back with its draft and sides. **Refuses unless it is the most
  recent game** (`not-last`), because undoing an older game renumbers the games and the next
  draft would overwrite a game that was played; refuses at 0 (`no-points`), and the button
  is disabled at 0 from the server's score, not the text box.
- **Fixed: a correction left stale game winners in later matches.** Reproduced first: correct a
  semifinal after the final was played, and the bracket reset the final to 0-0 while its game
  kept `winner = blue`, so hero win rates, the team view, Head to head and Pick / ban history
  all still credited the team that had been removed. `wipeResult` in `store/matches.ts` now
  clears the winners of the games of every match it resets (drafts kept, so pick/ban rates
  still count what was played), and `recordSeriesResult` announces `games` whenever the series
  winner changes so Analytics refreshes.

**Notices for 3.1.1** (2026-09-16, both expire 2026-10-16) replaced the 3.1.0 pair with the
same split: `update-3-1-1` (3.0.9–3.1.0, press Update now) and `update-3-1-1-older`
(3.0.8 and older, goes in on close).

**Notices for 3.1.0** (2026-09-15, both expire 2026-10-15) replaced the 3.0.13 pair with the
same split: `update-3-1-0` (3.0.9–3.0.13, press Update now) and `update-3-1-0-older`
(3.0.8 and older, goes in on close).

**Notices for 3.0.13** (2026-09-15, both expire 2026-10-15) replaced the 3.0.12 pair with the
same split: `update-3-0-13` (3.0.9–3.0.12, press Update now) and `update-3-0-13-older`
(3.0.8 and older, goes in on close).

**Notices for 3.0.12** (2026-09-15, both expire 2026-10-15) replaced the 3.0.11 pair with the
same split: `update-3-0-12` (3.0.9–3.0.11, press Update now) and `update-3-0-12-older`
(3.0.8 and older, goes in on close).

**Notices for 3.0.11** (2026-09-15, both expire 2026-10-15) replaced the 3.0.8 one, and are
**split by version because the install step differs**: `update-3-0-11` (3.0.9–3.0.10) says to
press Update now, since those builds never install by themselves; `update-3-0-11-older`
(3.0.8 and older) says it goes in on close, which is still true of those builds. A future
update notice needs the same split for as long as anyone may still be on 3.0.8 or older. 3.0.8 carries the flow and UI work: one-press GAME OVER with SERIES
OVER and Put on air (`POST /api/live-match/finish`), a Control Panel whose team setup and sound
fold away, and a Home that shows what is on air and what is ready to play
(`GET /api/ready-matches`). It was smoke-tested for real before packing. Its notice
(`update-3-0-8`, for 3.0.7 and older, expires 2026-10-15) replaced the 3.0.6 one in
`notices.json` on 2026-09-14.

## 1. Confirmed decisions

Settled with the user on 2026-09-11. Do not re-litigate.

- **v3 is a new app in its own folder** (`rov_overlay_v3`). **`../rov_pickban_overlay`
  (v2) is never modified**: no builds, no `npm start`, no edits. Read from it only.
  Running `npm start` there rebuilds its `build/` and opens its database.
- **The overlays stay HTML/CSS/JS**, served to OBS as browser sources, unchanged from v2.
- **The operator UI is native C#** (WPF). The user picked native over a React shell
  inside Electron.
- **The look is a pro broadcast tool**: dense, dark, lots on screen, like OBS, vMix or
  Discord. The v2 colour rules carry over (gold = happening now, blue/red = game sides).
- **Same functionality as v2, better UI.** Nothing is dropped; every v2 page either
  gets a native screen or stays reachable as its HTML page until it does.
- **Future: real-time patches and notifications to users** (§5). Built in later
  milestones, but designed now so nothing blocks them.
- **The tournament page keeps its OBS source list** (decided 2026-09-14). v2 removed it
  from `/tournament/:id` on 2026-09-08 at the user's request, and `backend/CLAUDE.md` still
  says so; asked again for v3, the user chose to keep the per-tournament links (Standings,
  Team list, Stats board for that tournament). Do not remove it on the rulebook's word.
- **All data stays local**, as in v2. The update and notice checks only *read* public
  files; there are no accounts and no telemetry.

## 2. Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐        HTTP + Socket.IO        ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ desktop/  RovOverlayTool.exe │ ─────────────────────────────▶ │ backend/  node server.js │
│ WPF, .NET 10                 │   127.0.0.1:3000               │ Express, Socket.IO       │
│ operator screens             │ ◀── stateUpdate, dataChanged ── │ node:sqlite, state.json  │
└──────────────┬───────────────┘                                └────────────┬─────────────┘
               │ starts, owns, stops (stdin pipe + job object)               │ serves
               └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
                                                        OBS browser sources ◀┘  /overlay, /result, ...
```

**Why the Node backend stays.** The overlays speak Socket.IO, and they must not change,
so the server has to speak it too; SignalR cannot. The backend also carries all the
tournament logic, the one `sanitizeState` both sides trust, and 349 tests. Rewriting it
in C# would be months of work for no user-visible gain. The desktop app is purely a
client of the same API the HTML pages use.

**Process model** (`desktop/.../Services/BackendHost.cs`):

1. Probe `GET /api/app-info`. If a **v3** backend answers, attach to it (this is how
   `npm run dev` works during development). Settings shows "attached".
2. If anything else holds the port (almost always v2), **refuse** with a clear message.
   `/api/app-info` exists only in v3, which is what makes the check trustworthy.
3. Otherwise start `node server.js` with `ROV_USER_DATA_DIR`, `ROV_USER_MEDIA_DIR`,
   `PORT`, `HOST=127.0.0.1` and `ROV_EXIT_WITH_PARENT=1`, and wait for `/api/app-info`.
4. **Stopping:** close the child's stdin. `backend/server/lifecycle.ts` flushes the
   debounced `state.json` write, closes SQLite and exits (tested in
   `tests/lifecycle.test.ts`). Kill only if it has not gone after 3 s.
5. **Crash safety:** the child is in a Windows job object with `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so
   it can never outlive the app and squat on port 3000.

**Where node comes from:** `backend/runtime/node.exe` if present (the packaged app),
otherwise `node` on PATH (development). Node must be 22.5+ for `node:sqlite`.

**Data:** `%APPDATA%\RovOverlayTool3\` holds `data\` (tournament.db, state.json),
`media\` (logos, skins) and `settings.json` (language, port). It is separate from
v2's `%APPDATA%\ROV Overlay Tool\`, which v3 never reads on its own, and from the
install folder, which the updater replaces wholesale.

**Port:** 3000 by default, so existing OBS scenes keep working. v2 and v3 cannot run
at the same time on it.

## 3. Desktop app conventions

- **MVVM without a toolkit.** `Core/ObservableObject`, `RelayCommand`,
  `AsyncRelayCommand` (no double-fire; failures become an error toast). Kept dependency
  free so the project builds offline from the .NET SDK alone.
- **Adding a native screen:** a view model in `ViewModels/`, a `UserControl` in
  `Views/`, one `DataTemplate` line in `App.xaml`, then swap the `Legacy(...)` entry in
  `ShellViewModel` for the new view model.
- **Page view models are created once and kept** (`NavItem.Page`), so switching screens
  keeps unsaved input.
- **Live data:** `AppServices` raises `StateUpdated` (the overlay state),
  `DataChanged` (topics `teams`, `tournaments`, `roster`, `matches`, `games`, `live`)
  and `ConnectionChanged`, all on the UI thread. Screens re-read on the topics they show,
  exactly as the v2 pages did.
- **Text:** `Services/Loc.cs`. XAML `{svc:T Key}`, code `Loc.T` / `Loc.F`. Thai is the
  default. Reuse v2's Thai wording (`backend/public/js/lib/i18n.js`) when the same text
  existed there.
- **Theme:** `Theme/Theme.xaml` is the only place colours are defined. Green appears
  only on the connection light.
- **Motion is short, and there is very little of it.** Hover fades in over 90ms and out
  over 140ms; a screen fades up over 140ms as it arrives; a toast slides in from the edge
  it lives on; dialogs fade and scale from 0.97. That is the whole budget. This is a panel
  someone stares at for an entire event, and anything that moves while they are reading it
  is a defect. The single repeating animation is the draft clock pulsing under ten
  seconds, and that one exists to be caught by peripheral vision rather than to look nice.
  Animate `Opacity` or a transform, never the shared brushes: they are frozen resources
  and animating them throws.
- **Icons:** Segoe Fluent Icons (Windows 11) with Segoe MDL2 Assets as fallback. Write
  glyphs as `\uE80F` in C# and `&#xE80F;` in XAML, never as raw characters (§9).
- **Checking a screen without a person:** `RovOverlayTool.exe --page Home --lang en
  --snapshot out.png` renders the window to a PNG and exits. The snapshot run uses its
  own single-instance name, so it works beside an open app.

## 4. Screen migration

| v2 page | v3 now | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `/` Home: tournament list, create | **Native** | done (M1) |
| `/` Home: backup and restore | **Native**, in Settings | done (M2) |
| `/tournament/:id` | **Native** (details, roster with inline team editor, add/create team, match summary, standings and playoff draw, per-tournament OBS URLs) | done (M2) |
| `/teams` | **Native** (search, create with players and logo, multi-select bulk delete, W-L and tournament counts) | done (M2) |
| `/teams/:id` | **Native** (roster and logo editor, tournaments, match history) | done (M2) |
| `/control` Control Panel | **Native** (match info, on-air switches, draft timer with the 16-phase sequence and round stepper, both sides with rosters, lanes, picks, bans, logos, registry load, sound levels, undo/switch/reset, keyboard shortcuts) | done (M3) |
| `/tournament/:id/bracket` | **Native** (bracket drawn on a canvas with connectors, draw/redraw/clear, random draw, score boxes, put a match on air) | done (M4) |
| `/analytics` | **Native** (presence/pick/ban/win/ban-priority table, tournament and team scope, hero search, the draft in progress shown apart) | done (M4) |
| `/tournament/:id/drafts` | **Native** (every recorded draft as portraits, team and hero filters) | done (M4) |
| `/design` | **Native** (theme colours and sizes, six background-image slots with upload/clear and previews, the two skin switches) | done (M5) |
| `/hotkeys` | **Native**, including system-wide hotkeys through Win32 `RegisterHotKey` | done (M5) |
| `/guide` | **Native**, rendered from `backend/docs/USER_GUIDE.md` in the app language, with a search box | done (M5) |
| OBS URL list | **Native** (title bar) | done (M1) |
| Settings | **Native** | done (M1) |

**Electron-only v2 features that need a v3 answer:**

- Global hotkeys: **done in M5** through Win32 `RegisterHotKey` in `Services/GlobalHotkeyHost.cs`.
- The first-run licence agreement dialog: M7, with the installer.
- The app menu that opened overlay windows so sound effects play: see §8.

## 5. Updates and notifications (built in M7)

**Updates: Velopack 1.2.0**, the only third-party package in the app.

- `scripts/pack.ps1` stages a self-contained `dotnet publish`, the backend with a clean
  production `npm ci`, and `node.exe` into `backend/runtime/`, then runs `vpk pack`.
  Staged bundle 255 MB; installer 124 MB, plus a portable zip and a full `.nupkg`.
- It strips `public/images/team-logos` and `skins` from the stage first. Those are
  whatever the person building happened to upload, and v2 once shipped them to everyone.
- Feed: **GitHub Releases on `LazyAF-zZzZ/rov_overlay_v3`**, public because a private
  feed would need every user to hold a token. `pack.ps1 -Publish` uploads; without that
  switch nothing reaches anyone.
- Checked on start and every six hours, downloaded in the background. The operator is
  told it is ready and **nothing is installed until they press "Update now"** (the popup,
  or the version number in the title bar). Until 3.0.8 it also went in by itself when the
  app closed; **the user asked for that to be removed on 2026-09-15**. Two switches carry
  it: `ApplyOnExit` is gone, and `VelopackApp.Build().SetAutoApplyOnStartup(false)` in
  `Program.cs`, because Velopack otherwise applies a downloaded update on the next start by
  default - removing only the on-close install would have moved it to startup.
  Copies at 3.0.8 or older still install on close, including when the release that removes
  it reaches them.
- Channels `stable` and `beta`, chosen in Settings and read fresh on every check.
- Only an installed copy can update. A portable copy, or a build from the repo, says so
  in Settings instead of pretending to check.

**Notifications: a notice feed**, with no server of ours.

- `notices.json` in the repository root, read over HTTPS on start and every six hours:
  `{ id, level: info|warning|critical, title: {th, en}, body: {th, en}, url?,
  minVersion?, maxVersion?, expires? }`.
- A bell with a count in the title bar, a panel to read them, and a toast for new ones.
  Dismissed ids are kept in `settings.json`, so a notice does not come back.
- The version filtering happens on the operator's machine, so **nothing about them is
  sent**: the app only GETs one public file. Offline, nothing is shown and nothing warns.

| S5 | Later: sales website on Cloudflare Pages; a gateway issuing the same keys automatically | not started |

## 8. Open items

- **The installed copy was installed from the agent session, so it lives in a sandbox.**
  Its desktop shortcut points into `Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache` and shows no icon. It
  needs uninstalling from Windows Settings and reinstalling by double-clicking the Setup
  file in Explorer, which is the only way to get real paths, working shortcuts and a
  correct icon. Check the tournaments survived afterwards; if not, the data is under
  `Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache\Roaming\RovOverlayTool3` and copies straight across.
- **3.0.5 is published.** Released 2026-09-12 as `v3.0.5` on
  `LazyAF-zZzZ/rov_overlay_v3`, public, five assets, with `releases.win.json` offering
  3.0.5 Full. That is the first thing anyone outside this machine can install.
- **An update has now gone from one version to the next on its own.** The installed 3.0.4
  found 3.0.5 in the feed, downloaded it into `packages/`, and `current/` became 3.0.5
  without anyone running Setup. What is *not* verified is the operator's view of it: the
  updated app restarts outside the agent session's sandbox, so its API stops being
  reachable from here and the window is the only thing left to read.
- **3.0.7 was published twice, replacing itself.** The first `v3.0.7` (the grey filter
  alone) was deleted with `gh release delete v3.0.7 --cleanup-tag` and packed again from
  `d1c607f`, which added the guide's v2-import section and the `candidatePaths()` fix.
  Two things this depends on: the local `releases/` 3.0.7 nupkgs must be deleted first or
  the delta is built against 3.0.7 rather than 3.0.6, and **anyone who already downloaded
  the first 3.0.7 never receives the second** — same version number, so the updater has
  nothing to offer them. One `-full.nupkg` download had already happened. Replacing a
  version in place is only safe in the first minutes after publishing, before a notice
  goes out; otherwise cut the next number.
- **3.0.7 shipped without the smoke test, because the operator's own app was running.**
  `scripts\smoke.ps1` refuses to start a second copy (the single-instance mutex would
  make it show "already open" and exit, which is not what it tests), and closing the
  user's live app to satisfy it was not something to do unasked. 3.0.7 changes only
  `overlay.css`, `overlay.js`, the guide and the version number — no C# at all — and
  3.0.6 was the build running on screen at the time. **That reasoning does not
  generalise**: any release that touches `desktop/` must wait for the app to be closed
  and be smoke-tested for real.
- **Third place exists only for single elimination.** The knockout stage drawn after a
  group stage is the same shape with the same need; `addThirdPlace()` drops straight into
  that path when someone asks for it.
- **A notice has been delivered; dismissing one has not been checked.** A test entry was
  pushed to `notices.json` on 2026-09-12 and reached the installed 3.0.4 on its next
  start: the bell showed a count of one, photographed from the running app. What is still
  untried is pressing "Got it" and confirming it stays gone after a restart, which is the
  half that writes to `settings.json`.
- **Anything in its own window cannot be checked by a render.** `--snapshot` draws the
  main window's content with `RenderTargetBitmap`, and a `Popup` or a modal `Window` is a
  separate HWND it never sees. So the notice panel, the OBS source list, the confirm box
  and the **first-run licence dialog** are verified by their markup, their strings and
  their data, never by a screenshot. The licence dialog is the first thing a new user
  meets, so look at it by hand at least once.
- **No v2 data exists on this machine to import.** `%APPDATA%\ROV Overlay Tool` does not
  exist and the database in the v2 repo has zero rows, so the importer was proved
  against a synthetic v2 install instead. Run it once against a real one.
- **Click through M2 and M3.** Create a tournament and a team, edit a roster
  inline, upload and clear a logo, remove a team, delete a tournament, save a backup and
  restore it; then run a real draft: type heroes, Enter to confirm, the timer, the
  shortcuts, swap, undo. Rendering is verified; these flows are not. **There is UI
  automation now**: `scripts/uia.ps1` presses buttons by their text, reads fields back and
  captures windows and dialogs, against a snapshot build left open with a long
  `--snapshot-delay` beside a throwaway backend. It has only been pointed at the game-over
  flow so far, and on its first run it found a real bug there (the match title field
  frozen after Put on air). The flows above are the next thing to point it at.
- **The Control Panel's shortcuts only work while the app has focus.** System-wide
  hotkeys (Win32 `RegisterHotKey`) cover the draft, and since the score-keys work also +1 / -1
  and the rounds, and since 3.1.0 they are on by default under the name "Hotkeys".
- **Sound effects still need an overlay page open to be heard on air** (§8, unchanged by
  M3). The Control Panel's TEST button plays locally only.
- **Standings ignore the "teams through" box until it is a valid 1-8**; an invalid value
  keeps the last good one. Fine, but it shows no error.
- **Sound effects.** In v2 the Electron menu opened the overlay in a window so its
  `?sfx=1` audio played. v3 has no such window. Decide in M3: an OBS browser source
  with "Control audio via OBS", or a hidden WebView2 player.
- **Code signing.** An unsigned installer gets a SmartScreen warning.
- **`CONTROL_TOKEN`** is not used by v3 (the server binds 127.0.0.1 only). Revisit if
  the server is ever exposed on the LAN.

## 9. Traps already paid for

- **`"yyyy"` writes the Buddhist year under th-TH.** The app runs with a Thai culture, so
  `DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd")` gave `2569-09-28`. Anything stored or compared uses
  `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`; only text shown to people should follow the language (found
  in S3, 2026-09-28). The backup file name in Settings (`rov-overlay-backup-{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd}`)
  still follows the culture: not fixed, since a Thai year in a Thai user's file name is harmless.
- **Do not run anything in `../rov_pickban_overlay`.** Its `npm start` rebuilds its
  `build/` and opens its `data/tournament.db`.
- **The Browser pane's `preview_start` by name runs v2.** It reads `.claude/launch.json` from the
  workspace root (the parent folder), whose only entry starts `rov_pickban_overlay`, not from
  `rov_overlay_v3/.claude/`. On 2026-09-15 asking for a v3 preview entry started v2 on port 3000
  instead; it was stopped within a minute (v2's `build/` rebuilt from unchanged source, only
  `data/tournament.db-shm` touched, no data written). To look at an overlay, open the URL of a
  server that is already running; never start one by name here.
- **To UI Automation, a window with an Owner is not a top-level window.** The confirm
  dialog (`Owner` = the main window) is listed *underneath* the main window, not among the
  desktop's children. Searching the desktop's children for it finds nothing, which reads
  exactly like "the button never opened a dialog". Look for `ControlType.Window`
  descendants of the main window instead (`scripts/uia.ps1` does).
- **PowerShell variable names ignore case.** A function parameter named `$scope` hid the
  script's `$Scope` (the `TreeScope` type) inside that one function, so
  `$Scope::Descendants` became null there and worked everywhere else.
- **Icon glyphs as raw characters vanish or get mangled.** Perl's and sed's `\u` in a
  replacement means "uppercase the next character", which turned `\uE80F` into `E80F`.
  Write escapes by hand, or rewrite with Node.
- **WPF's implicit usings leave out `System.IO`** (it clashes with `Shapes.Path`), so
  `MemoryStream` and `File` need `using System.IO;`.
- **The TextBox template must not set scrollbar visibility** on `PART_ContentHost`, or
  no TextBox (the log box included) can ever scroll.
- **A closed ComboBox shows the selected item's `ToString()`, not its
  `DisplayMemberPath`**, with our own ComboBox template. The position picker showed
  `RovOverlay.Desktop.ViewModels.PositionChoice`. Every choice type overrides
  `ToString()` to return its label; do the same for any new one.
- **`vpk` builds its feed from whatever is sitting in `releases/`.** A rehearsal build
  left in that folder goes out with the real one, and users are offered a version nobody
  meant to ship. Clear the folder before packing a release, and accept that the first
  release therefore has no delta to build against.
- **Never run the installer from inside the agent session.** That session is sandboxed:
  writes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and `%APPDATA%` are redirected into
  `AppData\Local\Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache\`, so Setup records container paths in the
  shortcuts it creates. The desktop shortcut ends up with a target inside the container
  and an icon path outside it, which Explorer draws as a blank page. Worse, the session
  cannot detect any of this: reads fall through, so both paths look identical and equally
  present from in here. Build the installer here; let the user double-click it.
- **Backslashes disappear when a script is written through a shell heredoc.** The command
  text is JSON-encoded before the shell sees it, so `\\` arrives as a single `\`, and
  JavaScript then reads the `\s` and `\p` of `.\scripts\pack.ps1` as plain letters. This
  file twice ended up telling the reader to run `.scriptspack.ps1`. Write anything
  containing Windows paths with the editing tool instead, or build the character with
  `String.fromCharCode(92)` as the glyph fixer does.
- **A window shown before `Application.Run()` pumps messages is never created at all.**
  `OnStartup` is raised inside `Run()` but *before* the message loop starts. The licence
  dialog was asked for there, and being `WindowStyle=None`, `ShowInTaskbar=False` and
  `CenterOwner` with no owner yet, it never materialised: `ShowDialog()` waited for an
  answer from a window that did not exist. 3.0.0 installed, started, and sat as a healthy
  process with no window. Show the main window first and let anything modal own it.
- **A handler that sets `Handled = true` can hide the failure completely.** The startup
  exception path showed a toast, and a toast needs a window. Before the window exists,
  write the failure to `%APPDATA%\RovOverlayTool3\startup-error.log`, show a plain
  `MessageBox` (no `Loc` — it may be what broke) and stop.
- **`--snapshot` proves a screen renders, not that the app starts.** It deliberately skips
  the first-run licence, so the one path every new user takes was the one path never run
  in seven milestones of verification. `scripts/smoke.ps1` launches the built app and
  fails unless a real visible window appears; `-FreshLicence` does it as a new user.
  Run it before any release.
- **`execFileSync` blocks Node's event loop**, so a server in the same script cannot
  answer while a child process runs. A local notice feed served that way looked exactly
  like a broken notice service: the app's request went unanswered until its own 15-second
  timeout. Use `spawn` and await the exit.
- **Velopack has to run before WPF opens anything.** WPF generates its own `Main` from
  App.xaml, so ours lives in `Program.cs` and `<StartupObject>` picks it. `vpk pack`
  checks this really happened: "Verified VelopackApp.Run() in ... Program::Main".
- **A v2 database can be in WAL mode**, and its newest rows live in the `-wal` file.
  Copy the database and its `-wal`/`-shm` aside and open the copy: opening v2's own
  file would replay the log and write to the folder we promised never to touch.
- **A `Style` attribute plus a `<TextBlock.Style>` element on the same control is a
  compile error, not a merge.** Put `BasedOn` inside the inline style instead.
- **`PathFigure` / `PolyLineSegment` do not take bindings** the way a normal element
  does; the bracket connectors are `Polyline`s bound to a `PointCollection`.
- **`BackendHost.BackendDir` must be found even when the app only attaches** to a
  server someone else started, or screens that read files shipped with the backend
  (the Guide) come up empty in development.
- **Setting `DataContext` on an element that also binds through the outer one blanks the
  field silently.** `DataContext="{Binding Player}"` next to `Text="{Binding Player.Name}"`
  resolves as `Player.Player.Name`: no error, just an empty box. Set the DataContext, then
  use plain property names.
- **A second ItemsControl pulled over the first with a negative margin does not line
  up.** Picks were drawn that way at first and simply never appeared. One list whose rows
  carry everything in the row is the fix.
- **Pages opened on top (tournament, team) must unsubscribe** from
  `AppServices.DataChanged` and `Loc.Changed` in `IClosablePage.OnClosed`, or every page
  ever opened keeps reloading itself for the rest of the session.
- **Rows are updated in place by id, never rebuilt**, when a change is pushed from
  elsewhere: rebuilding would throw away an inline editor someone is typing in (the same
  rule as v2's `deferWhileEditing`).
- **`RenderTargetBitmap` renders nothing behind the content**, so the window's root
  border carries the background brush itself, or snapshots come out transparent.
- **The job object kills the backend at once if the app crashes**, before
  `lifecycle.ts` can flush. A normal close is graceful; a crash can lose the last
  150 ms of state. Accepted: the alternative is a server squatting on port 3000.
- **Backend changes from v2:** `package.json` (Electron removed, version 3.0.0-dev),
  `server.js` (lifecycle hook), `server/index.ts` (app-info route),
  `server/store/live-state.ts` (`flushState`), `tests/media.test.ts` (its installer
  guard now reads `scripts/pack.ps1` instead of electron-builder), plus
  the new files named in §6. Everything else is byte-for-byte v2.

## 10. Supporter keys (planned 2026-09-27; S1 done the same day)

**Why.** The user wants income from the app without selling it, which the free licence
forbids for others and which would mean selling Garena/Tencent's hero art. The model is
Spectra's (Valorant): the app stays free with every feature; a paid **supporter** plan
removes a watermark from the overlays and adds perks. Supporters pay for the maker's
branding going away, never for game content. A paid "Pro" copy (`../rov_overlay_pro`) and
then a login system (Supabase, Discord/Google) were both considered the same day and
dropped: **the user chose keys only, no accounts and no server.**

**Design.**
- A key carries its own data and an **Ed25519 signature**: key id, supporter name, plan,
  expiry date, e.g. `RVS1-....`. The app holds only the **public** key, so checking is
  **offline**, with nothing of ours online. A broadcast never depends on the internet.
- The **backend** checks keys (Node's built-in `crypto`, no package): signature, then
  expiry. The key is stored in the user data folder; an API saves, reads and removes it;
  `supporter: true/false` reaches the overlays over the existing socket.
- **Watermark** lives in `public/js/overlay-size.js`, which every overlay already loads, so
  all ten get it from one place; a page may move it with a data attribute. Looks can only
  be confirmed by the user in OBS.
- **Settings** gets a Supporter section: key box, "Supporter: <name> until <date>",
  remove, and a button to the maker's page. A reminder 7 days before expiry; after expiry
  the watermark returns and nothing else changes.
- **Key generator** (`make-key --name "Team X" --months 12`) runs on the maker's PC. The
  **secret key never enters this repo**, which is public: it lives in the maker's profile
  folder, with a backup they keep themselves. Lose it and no new keys can be made that
  existing apps accept.
- **Sharing.** Offline keys cannot count PCs, so the "2 PCs" the user wanted is a licence
  term, not something the app enforces. What helps: the supporter's name shows in the app,
  and a **revoked-keys list** (key ids in the public repo, next to `notices.json`) is read
  when online, so a leaked key can be switched off.
- **Payment** starts as PromptPay checked by hand, key sent by the maker. Later a gateway
  (Opn/Omise or Stripe) can issue the same keys automatically; the app does not change.
- **Honest limit:** the source is public, so someone who codes can remove the watermark.
  Spectra has the same limit; supporters pay mostly to support the maker.

**Built in S1 (2026-09-27).**
- Key: `RVS1-<base64url JSON {v,id,n,p,i,e}>.<base64url Ed25519 signature>`, about 215
  characters. The signature covers the prefix too. Whitespace is stripped before checking,
  because keys arrive through LINE and email. `e` is the last valid day, **Bangkok time**
  (`expiresAt` = 23:59:59.999 +07:00).
- `domain/supporter.ts` is pure (`readKey`, `checkKey`, `signKey`) and holds the maker's
  **public** key. Tests swap it with `useVerifyKeyForTests`, **deliberately not an env var**:
  an env override would let anyone self-sign keys without touching the code.
- `store/supporter.ts` keeps `supporter.json` (the key) and `revoked-keys.json` (last
  downloaded list) in the data folder. Only a key that works today is saved; a bad or
  expired paste never replaces a good key. A download that is not a JSON array (offline,
  404, captive portal) leaves the old list in force, so going offline never un-revokes.
- API: `GET /api/supporter` (no token, never returns the key), `PUT` `{ key }` (400 with
  `code`: format / signature / expired / revoked and a readable `error`; renamed from
  `problem` in S3 so `ApiException.Code` picks it up), `DELETE`.
  Socket event **`supporter`** on connect and on every visible change; overlays use it in S2.
- `startSupporterWatch()` runs from `start()` only (tests never reach the network):
  revoked list from `REVOKED_LIST_URL` (`revoked-keys.json` at the repo root) every 6 h,
  expiry re-check every hour.
- **The maker's secret key is at `%USERPROFILE%\.rov-supporter\signing-key.pem`**, made
  with `node backend/tools/supporter-keys.js init`, which refuses to overwrite it. Keys:
  `make --name "Team X" --months 12` (or `--until YYYY-MM-DD`); `read <key>` checks one.
  The tool signs with the compiled `build/` code, so run `npm run build` first. A test
  asserts no private key ever appears in `supporter.ts`.
- `revoked-keys.json` is not on GitHub until the repo is pushed; until then every fetch
  404s, which is harmless.

**Built in S2 (2026-09-27).**
- The watermark is created and styled by `public/js/overlay-size.js`, which all ten
  broadcast graphics load after the script that declares `socket`. Styles are injected
  from there because broadcast pages share no stylesheet. Text "ROV Overlay Tool · by
  LazyAF", 19px bold, white at 85% with a dark shadow (was 15px at 60% in beta.1; the user asked for bigger and brighter), `pointer-events: none`, scaled 4/3 at 1440.
- **It starts hidden** and appears only when the `supporter` event says inactive. Showing
  it first would flash it on a supporter's stream every time OBS loads a source. The flip
  side: an overlay that never reaches the server shows no watermark, which is acceptable
  because such an overlay shows nothing else either.
- Position is bottom-right unless `<body data-watermark>` says otherwise. Checked with
  `elementsFromPoint` on all ten pages at 1920x1080 (2560x1440 for `/overlay-1440`):
  bottom-right sat on red player 5's name on the draft overlay; `/result` uses `bottom-left`
  (empty lower part of the red side panel). The stage graphics all keep 62px or more of
  bottom padding, so bottom-right is clear on them.
- **Draft overlays: inside the banner** (user's request, 2026-09-28, replacing an
  "above the panel" spot from the same day). `/overlay` and `/overlay-1440` mark
  `.pick-section` with `data-watermark-slot`; `overlay-size.js` then puts the mark inside it
  (17px, right-aligned 336px from the right edge, `top: 41px; translateY(-50%)`: just left
  of the red ban slots, its middle on theirs). Inside the panel, the container's 4/3 scale
  carries it to 1440. **Layout pixels tied to the banner; move them if it changes.**
  `overlay.js` never rebuilds `.pick-section`, which is why appending into it is safe.
- **The logo is part of the mark** (user's request, 2026-09-28): `<img>` of
  `watermark-logo.png` then a `<span>` with the text, inside the one `.rov-watermark` flex
  row, 1.45em tall (25px in the banner, 28px in corners) at 85% like the text, with a drop
  shadow. Being a child, it hides with the mark: no second element for a key to miss. Two
  earlier tries the same day were dropped: 84px behind the tournament name, then 150px at 60%
  behind the score's VS (that one needed `z-index: -1` inside `.match-center`, a stacking
  context, to stay under the score; worth knowing if a logo ever goes back there).
- `watermark-logo.png` is the app icon's shield with the dark tile cut away (kept: pixels
  with `luminance + 200 × saturation` above ~140, i.e. the gold and silver), cropped to
  169x175. Made once from `app-icon.ico`; remake it the same way if the icon changes.
- Tests: every `/overlay*` route and `/result` (derived from `PAGES`) loads
  `overlay-size.js` after its own script; the watermark starts hidden.

**Built in S3 (2026-09-28).**
- Settings, second section (under Language): the hint, a status line with a gold star when
  active, **Remove key** (confirm first, `danger`), a paste box with a placeholder and
  **Use this key**. Errors are toasts in the app's language by `code` (`Supporter.Err.*`).
  **Become a supporter** is hidden while `SettingsViewModel.SupporterPageUrl` is empty,
  which it is until the maker has a page.
- `AppServices` listens to the `supporter` socket event (`Supporter`, `SupporterChanged`).
  Status is null until the server speaks, and the screen says "waiting" rather than "no key".
- **Reminder:** a toast, never a dialog, when an active key has 7 days or fewer left or a key
  has run out, at most once a day (`AppSettings.SupporterRemindedOn`, invariant date).
- Dates show as `2 Oct 2026` / `2 ต.ค. 2569` via `SupporterDates.Show` and `Loc.Instance.Culture`.
- Disclaimer (`Settings.Disclaimer`) under About, in the same words Spectra uses for Riot.
- Verified: snapshots of no key, 5 days left (Thai) and expired (English), with the toasts;
  then `scripts/uia.ps1 -Action set-text` (new) and clicks in a live window against a
  throwaway backend on port 3000: bad key → error toast; a key wrapped over three lines →
  accepted with the thank-you; Remove → confirm → gone. The user's real data folder was
  never written.

**3.2.0-beta.1 built locally 2026-09-28, not published** (`pack.ps1 -Version 3.2.0-beta.1 -Channel beta`,
no `-Publish`): `releases/RovOverlayTool3-beta-Setup.exe` and `-beta-Portable.zip`, notes in
`docs/release-notes/3.2.0-beta.1.md`. The portable copy passed `smoke.ps1`; the bundle holds
`supporter.js` and the watermark, and neither the key tool nor the secret key. `package.json` and
the csproj still say 3.1.2 (pack passes the version to dotnet only); bump both before a real release.
The user is trying it with a one-month test key. **3.2.0-beta.2** (same way, 2026-09-28) moves the draft overlay's watermark into the banner with the logo behind the title; not smoke-tested because the user's installed app held the single-instance lock, and only overlay files changed since beta.1 passed. **3.2.0-beta.3** (2026-09-28): the logo moves behind the score at 150px; same build, same caveat. **3.2.0-beta.4** (2026-09-28): the logo becomes a small shield inside the mark, before the text.

**Before S1-S3 can ship:** the user sees the watermark in OBS; prices are chosen; a way to pay
exists (manual PromptPay is enough); ideally a page for "Become a supporter"; the commits
are pushed, which also publishes `revoked-keys.json`.

**Not decided yet:** prices and tiers (Spectra: EUR 15/25/40 a month; Thai guess THB 99-199
a month or 990-1,990 a year), watermark text and corner, perks beyond the watermark, and
whether the free licence should require shared modified copies to keep the watermark
(changing it bumps `LicenceVersion`).
