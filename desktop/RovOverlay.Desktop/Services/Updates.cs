// Auto-update, sitting in front of Velopack.
//
// One rule shapes this whole file: the operator decides when an update goes in. A new
// version is found and downloaded quietly, the operator is told it is ready, and it is
// installed only when they press "Update now" - never when the app closes, never when it
// starts, never on its own. The app never restarts itself, never steals focus and never
// opens a window of its own mid-broadcast.
//
// Installing on close used to happen too. The user asked for it to be removed, and
// Velopack's own install-on-start is switched off in Program.cs for the same reason.
//
// Only an installed copy can update itself. A portable copy, or a developer running
// from the repo, has no install for Velopack to replace; that is not an error, and the
// Settings screen says so plainly instead of pretending to check.
